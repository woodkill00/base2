# Home Page Assets

This folder is for Home page (public) marketing assets used by the React app.

## Sources

- Reference design bundle lives under `junk/idea/` in this repo.
- Any design-port intent for Home comes from these reference components:
  - `junk/idea/src/app/components/hero.tsx`
  - `junk/idea/src/app/components/features.tsx`
  - `junk/idea/src/app/components/trust-section.tsx`
  - `junk/idea/src/app/components/footer.tsx`

## Notes

- All icons used in Home UI must be inline SVG (vector-only). Avoid emoji icons.
- Keep assets lightweight; prefer SVG for decorative vectors.
